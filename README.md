# Tam Project

I developed this fitness application as part of my MSc Software Development degree thesis in 2019, investigating whether gamification affects users' activity levels. The app contains a Tamagotchi character, and the completion of daily step goals increases the happiness level of the character.

The user is able to set their own daily step goal, and Tamagotchi issues quests to the user in addition to their daily goals. Tamagotchi also sends reminders if the user has been inactive for some time (phone idle).

To complete this project, I used Google codelabs to learn Android development. In approximately one to one and a half months, I built this demo version of the application to test the hypothesis of my thesis: "Gamification in fitness apps may increase users' activity levels."

To develop this application, I used the Google Fit API to collect the necessary data to track users' activity levels. This API significantly sped up the development process and allowed me to include extra features that were initially not planned for the first release.
